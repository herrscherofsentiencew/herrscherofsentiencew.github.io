# Your very terrific pillow and teddy bear
## A little about me
- I currently study at Ateneo de Naga University Junior High School (well if it isn't obvious HAHAHA)
- I really REALLY. love cats. I'd die to ever have one.
- I like games. A lot of them. Ranging from FPS to RPGs. Small world.
## Games that I really, really love. <head>
