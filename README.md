## A little about me
- I currently study at Ateneo de Naga University Junior High School (well if it isn't obvious HAHAHA)

- I really REALLY. love cats. I'd die to ever have one.
- I like games. A lot of them. Ranging from FPS to RPGs. Small world.
# Some games that I have been really into since the start of the pandemic.
## Genshin Impact. 
Genshin Impact is an open-world action RPG with “gacha” (we’ll go over that later on) mechanics. It is developed and published by Chinese studio miHoYo. In it, players control a number of party members, each with different abilities, weapons, gear, and personalities. The combat plays out in real time, allowing players to utilize ranged, melee, and elemental attacks against a wide array of enemies across the game’s open world and dungeons.
