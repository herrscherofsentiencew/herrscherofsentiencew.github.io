Welcome. To, whatever this is.

You do not have anything to see here. 

Leave now.

Just kidding.



# A little about me.
- **I study in Ateneo de Naga Junior High School. Well, obviously since you're only able to see this if you're a batchmate or a classmate.**

- **I very much love games. From FPS to RPGs. A lot of kids my age do.** 

- **Cats. I ABSOLUTELY ADORE cats. I'd completely kill someone (just kidding) to have one.**

- **The best hugger you could ever ask for. Hugs aren't for free though. /j**
